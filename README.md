# Hierarchical-Actor-Critc-HAC-
This repository contains the code to implement the Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC) algorithm.  A more detailed README is coming soon.

To train a 4-layered agent in an inverted pendulum task, run "python3 initialize_HAC.py --retrain".  Mujoco software must be properly installed.  Command line options to change the agent's hierarchy or to visualize training can be found in the "options.py" file along with other options.  To train in a different Mujoco environment, follow the instructions in the "design_env.py" file.  

Happy to answer any questions you have.  Please email me at andrew_levy2@brown.edu.
